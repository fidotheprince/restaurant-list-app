# Welcome to Foody Finds (Restaurant List Application)

The ultimate goal of this application is generating revenue for local restaurants that do not have an online presence. This has become increasingly important when considering the hostility of the current economy to small business owners. 

Accordingly, the basic concept of the application is to have a user find a restaurant that does not have a “digital footprint”. Moreover, the user then utilizes this application to add that particular restaurant to a growing database of businesses serving tasty food. Once a restaurant is added, within the growing table of information, other users become aware of the business’ existence and can select to eat there. 

This application was developed within the .NET Framework utilizing an MVC design pattern. Users are able to delete, edit, and update restaurant additions.

Below are links for a demo of the application, user stories, and the specific technology stack implemented.

# Reflection

I adore the Model View Controller design pattern. Utilizing it through the .NET Framework enables me to understand the lifecycle of data. 

Specifically, I love how user input can change the characteristics of a data table in the backend.  

Accordingly, a .NET Web Application is like an iceberg. For example, the user sees the data (model) scaffolded through a View file. Then there is machinery in the background (controller) that decides what to do with input. 

Most of my difficulties with the application had to do with the configuration of adding LINQ and the Entity Framework on the backend. 

Although the logic is fairly straightforward, every action, or method in the .NET Framework can create unintended side-effect(s) to the state of the application. 

Therefore, it’s very important to consistently remember the way that different large components of the application are interacting with each other. This way, I as a programmer can predicate potential bugs or errors. On the other hand, when a bug or error arise, my deep undestanding of the MVC design pattern allow me to quickly identify the location of the error. Once I can trace the source of the malfunction. Then I can dynamically source the information required to fix it.
