# Welcome to Foody Finds (Restaurant List Application)

The ultimate goal of this application is generating revenue for local restaurants that do not have an online presence. This has become increasingly important when considering the hostility of the current economy to small business owners. 

Accordingly, the basic concept of the application is to have a user find a restaurant that does not have a “digital footprint”. Moreover, the user then utilizes this application to add that particular restaurant to a growing database of businesses serving tasty food. Once a restaurant is added, within the growing table of information, other users become aware of the business’ existence and can select to eat there. 

This application was developed within the .NET Framework utilizing an MVC design pattern. Users are able to delete, edit, and update restaurant additions.

Below are links for a demo of the application, user stories, and the specific technology stack implemented.
